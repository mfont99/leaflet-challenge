Module 15 challenge assignment

I found this challenge pretty hard. I knew what I had to do but executing it required me to reference the class material pretty much constantly. The entire process was essentially just copying certain lines of code from the in-class exercises, pasting them into the assignment, and changing around some values. And then using the Xpert Learning Assistant to debug/ask for suggestions when things inevitably errored out. 

At first, I also tried doing all the calculations and map building without using functions, and the Xpert Learning Assistant was very helpful showing me how to build out those functions in an efficient way. I learned how important functions are (not just in this assignment, just over all) in order to have a good flow and to make my code understandable for other people. Even when functions aren't required, using them is a good practice.
